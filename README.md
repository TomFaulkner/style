# Fynish Style

## What's Going on Here?

This outlines how we do things at Fynish. It is a work-in-progress, and may change over time as our own views on best practices change. 

Feel free to link here if you want to adopt anything here as your own style, but know that we are not doing any sort of version on our guide at this time. You may find that we have changed our minds on something, and that you now disagree with the guide to which you are linking. Linker beware.

There's no software here, but in case anyone cares, anything in the Fynish Style repo is released under a [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
